# My dot emacs file

Just my `.emacs` file. Maybe it serves somebody as inspiration.

A lot of the little tricks and functions are copied from other peoples
`.emacs` files - Thanks to all of them!  Unfortunately I was not
careful including references to the original authors. Of course I'm
happy to add missing references if you let me know.
